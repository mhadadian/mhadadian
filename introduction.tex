Data is the new oil \cite{humby2006data}. We heard this a lot since 2006. Although this comparison is not accurate, we can still use it to define data analysis. They are similar in that we should first extract them and then process them to gain valuable products. Data analysis is the process of converting raw data to worthy outcomes.  It is a multi-disciplinary field requiring skills ranging from mathematics, statistics, and computer science to business understanding in different areas. 

Data and oil are different so that, unlike oil, data is not depleting in the process, and also it comes in different forms. Data could be any information and fact such as water quality, traffic control picture, customer service recordings storing in different types such as numbers, video, and sound, respectively.  The most astonishing privilege of data over oil is its usefulness in almost every businesses. 










% what is data analysis and data science

% rapid updates in data and applications

% sources of update

% how application are depolyed in the industry and academy (refering to both paramter tuning and in production applications) and writing to much code

% need for update to be safe and fast

% why we need automation in designing pipelines 

% investigating the gap 

% what is our general goal/ project description to fill the gap
