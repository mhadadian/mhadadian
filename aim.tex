\section{Aim and Directions}
\label{sec:aim}
In this section, we will describe the possible directions and research question for compeleting the PhD.

1- (Update) How to perform an update. Assume that everything is given:  
                    * the current veriosn
                    * the the item to update

2- (Pipeline Management) Identify the items for update. Insertion and deletions. Check if it is possible to perform this update, validation check for other pipelines as well? Is it ok with other pipeline? dependency management. Give:
                    * The desired state

3- (Create a new pipeline) How to plan a pipeline. What to do with multiple-solution and how to choose one. Given:
                    * Data sources
                    * Gaols
                    * (optional) some other restrictions e.g. not using .

4- (Optimize platfrom, pipelines and physical environment) how to place the containers to reach performance metrics of pipelines. For example identifying number of instances and where to place them in a optimal way.
